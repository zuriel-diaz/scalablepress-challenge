## Countdown Timer 

Simple project to display a countdown timer. This means that we can set the deadline and run the index.html file via web browser, and that's it. 

### Dependencies 

- Web browser: Google chrome or Firefox. 

## Coin Flip

Project to generate random number without use the Math.random() function. 

### Dependencies

- Node.js

To execute the POC:

1. Change to 'coin-flip' directory.

`cd coin-flip/`

2. Run 'app.js' file. 

`node app.js`

But to be honest we can implement the same code in JS vanilla to avoid the dependencies or frameworks dependencies for this version.

Kind regards,
